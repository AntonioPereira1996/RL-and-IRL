The code in this directory and its subdirectory is notably used to produce the figures of [1]. 

The code is written in a literate programming form, using babel and org-mode [2]. It has been "literated" after been written normally, thus it is organized with respect to technical reasons, not as a mental flow. This kind of defeats the point of literate programming and should be corrected "soon".

The Makefile.org file contains a small summary of the content of each other file, as it describes the rules according to which the files must be combined to get the figures of [1].

The source code in this directory is managed by git [3]. It i also uploaded on GitHub [4]. Any bug fixes or suggestion are welcome.

I used the GSL [5] throughout the whole thing. Hence, the license under which this work is distributed is the GPL [6].
